# Programming Challenges

The whole point in this repo is to keep a singular place for all ma wee programming challenge solutions that I never end up committing anywhere and are just strewin about a harddrive somewhere.

My general approach is that I am not allowed any advanced autocomplete, intellisense on the current available API interactions of the object only (i.e. <b>string.</b> -> `format() | toLower() | ...`).  
I've allowed myself to use AI in the capacity of learning about a given topic but not to solve any solutions, an example in practice would be [Euclid's formula for finding pythagorean triplets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple) for [Project Euler's challenge 009](./project_euler/problem/009/brief.md) cos mate if you're expecting me to just whip that outta thin air yer havin a laugh.

This site is the core driver behind me actually making this repository. What a <b>belter</b> of a repository for problems. This is some of the most fun with programming I've had in recent memory.  
[Check out ma progress in this readme](./project_euler/README.md), but even better - give some of these a go for yourself!

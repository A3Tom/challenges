# Digit Fifth Powers

<p>Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:

1634 = 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4<br/>
8208 = 8^4 + 2^4 + 0^4 + 8^4<br/>
9474 = 9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4

</p><p class="smaller">As 1 = 1^4 is not a sum it is not included.</p>
<p>The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.</p>
<p>Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.</p>

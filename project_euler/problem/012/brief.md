# Highly Divisible Triangular Number

<p>The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. </p>
<p>So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:</p>
<p>1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...</p>
<p>Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:</p>
<p>
<strong>1</strong>: 1<br/>
<strong>3</strong>: 1, 3<br/>
<strong>6</strong>: 1, 2, 3, 6<br/>
<strong>10</strong>: 1, 2, 5, 10<br/>
<strong>15</strong>: 1, 3, 5, 15<br/>
<strong>21</strong>: 1, 3, 7, 21<br/>
<strong>28</strong>: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28<br/>
<p>We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.</p>
<p>What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?</p>
